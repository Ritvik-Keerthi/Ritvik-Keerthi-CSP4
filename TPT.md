### TPT Notes (5.1 - 5.6)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[5.3 Computing Bias](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b8-Ou9aGQezmaZRsTEWaY2JZIwdHIzxE/view?usp=sharing)
- There is a lot of bias within computing, mainly within explicit and implicit data. Explicit data would be a streaming site, (my own example being Amazon Prime), with your name and information, while implicit data could be what movies/shows you see. 

- Prime Video itself can also be biased, as it can redirect you to certain shows that you want to actually see, rather than boring movies, according to your recent searches. This can be something like Youtube Kids. 

5.3 Github Pages and Actions:

Watch the video... HP computers are racist 

Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas... 
Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? If yes or no, justify you conclusion. How do you think this happened? Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? Should it be corrected? What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?

- The owner of the computer does not believe that this is intentional. I also believe that this is not intentional as the developers of the software did not think of any other race when developing the software or algorithm. I think that this happened because the developers did not think about the diversity aspect of different races when developing the software. This was probably not intended to be harmful, however, should 100% be corrected. A better outcome could be produced if more developers were from different diverse races, so that all could come together to account for any possible outcomes. 

[5.4 Crowdsourcing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kgvjhR_EMEe3h5A5aa1idbKRXEEzTj7N/view?usp=sharing)

- Crowdsourcing is basically using a large population to market a certain idea or product. These things could be used in collaboration with others as well, examples being spotify. GoFundMe is also an example of crowd sourcing as it is a way to get money by collaborating with others. 

5.4 Github Pages and Actions: 

CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?

- A crowdsource idea I coulse use in CompSci with 150 principles students would be trying to get everyone to like the sport of basketball. I might initiate it in our environment by presenting all positive things, especially revenue and entertaning dunks, and other highlights that are appealing to people. In terms of Del Norte crowdsourcing, it might be a little bit harder. Because there are specific biases all around Del Norte, it would be a lot more difficult to convince people that basketball is a great sport. Our final project could easily be better with crowdsourcing, as more people would support our project, therefore gaining more traction and being more popular.


[5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-ezX6JN6ACtUE4fXxvd2TnkaVcoFzD65/view?usp=sharing)
- In terms of legal and ethical concerns, there can be copyrights and protection of intellectual property. 
- To go deeper into copyrights (legal copyrighting):
   - Creative Commons
   - Open source 
   - Open Access

[5.6 Safe Computing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JIxOvsWfI9YyXgqx6PQwXC6Xsw5T-pPP/view?usp=sharing)

- Safe computing techniques would be understanding how to only distribute information that is not personal to you and is not needed by the program. This can be your social security number, which if given, can result in identity theft. 
- Things like Keyloggers, Phising, and Rogue Access Points can also be detrimental to the user.
- Keylogger logs your keystrokes on your keyboard which is usually used to get a password. 
- Phishing: usually sent in emails, click on a link, and you're likely going to lose access of your computer.

[5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RXc68oLrmCTquHnKL4IQV9qIqkvJQb4L/view?usp=sharing)

- Different products can have different effects on the industry.
- Few examples
   - Multirotor, Quadcopter, 3D Printers
   - Internet can also have plenty of harmful impacts, as many people are heavily addicted to it. The Internet is used more than sleeping, according to the CB video. 
- Transactions Within Games
   - This can lead to many problems, like overspending, or kids spending money on their parents' credit cards, which can lead to financial problems. 
  

5.1 Github Pages Actions:

Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
- Beneficial: Ability to access more resources, interact with new people, learn new information. 
- Harmful: Ability to get addicted, have more dopamine issues, bad people can show up on the internet (think dark web)

Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
- There are real dopamine issues that people have. This isn't just some conspiracy theory; many people are heavily addicted to computing, specifically video games. 


[5.2 Digital Divide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MXKE5eKrMnXbcsAblrk7Bp0HRPcLy6Ub/view?usp=sharing)
- The main problem with this is that many people are underprivileged and do not have access to any sort of technology, namely a computer of some sort. People are in rural areas and this is defined as the digital divide.
- In some places, the internet is used as protection, not as something that can be used by the normal civilian (govt stuff)


5.2 Github Pages and Actions:

How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
- Someone can empower themself in a digital world because they can get ranks or higher positions for being better in video games, while their real life crumbles before their eyes. 


How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
- Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by helping them get access to technological resources. Something in Del Norte would be giving a computer to someone else in order to help them submit their assignment. 


Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
- Yes. Red tape could be exhibited in the example of the school blocking various websites, specifically in Del Norte. Elsewhere, paper can be used for tests, rather than computers possibly because of a lack of technological access, contributing further to the digital divide.
