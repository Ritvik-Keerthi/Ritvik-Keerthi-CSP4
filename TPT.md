### TPT Notes (5.1 - 5.6)
--------------------

[5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RXc68oLrmCTquHnKL4IQV9qIqkvJQb4L/view?usp=sharing)

- Different products can have different effects on the industry.
- Few examples
   - Multirotor, Quadcopter, 3D Printers
   - Internet can also have plenty of harmful impacts, as many people are heavily addicted to it. The Internet is used more than sleeping, according to the CB video. 
- Transactions Within Games
   - This can lead to many problems, like overspending, or kids spending money on their parents' credit cards, which can lead to financial problems. 


[5.2 Digital Divide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MXKE5eKrMnXbcsAblrk7Bp0HRPcLy6Ub/view?usp=sharing)
- The main problem with this is that many people are underprivileged and do not have access to any sort of technology, namely a computer of some sort. People are in rural areas and this is defined as the digital divide.
- In some places, the internet is used as protection, not as something that can be used by the normal civilian (govt stuff)

[5.3 Computing Bias](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b8-Ou9aGQezmaZRsTEWaY2JZIwdHIzxE/view?usp=sharing)
- There is a lot of bias within computing, mainly within explicit and implicit data. Explicit data would be a streaming site, (my own example being Amazon Prime), with your name and information, while implicit data could be what movies/shows you see. 

- Prime Video itself can also be biased, as it can redirect you to certain shows that you want to actually see, rather than boring movies, according to your recent searches. This can be something like Youtube Kids. 

[5.4 Crowdsourcing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kgvjhR_EMEe3h5A5aa1idbKRXEEzTj7N/view?usp=sharing)
- Crowdsourcing is basically using a large population to market a certain idea or product. These things could be used in collaboration with others as well, examples being spotify. GoFundMe is also an example of crowd sourcing as it is a way to get money by collaborating with others. 

[5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-ezX6JN6ACtUE4fXxvd2TnkaVcoFzD65/view?usp=sharing)
- In terms of legal and ethical concerns, there can be copyrights and protection of intellectual property. 
- To go deeper into copyrights (legal copyrighting):
   - Creative Commons
   - Open source 
   - Open Access

[5.6 Safe Computing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JIxOvsWfI9YyXgqx6PQwXC6Xsw5T-pPP/view?usp=sharing)

- Safe computing techniques would be understanding how to only distribute information that is not personal to you and is not needed by the program. This can be your social security number, which if given, can result in identity theft. 
- Things like Keyloggers, Phising, and Rogue Access Points can also be detrimental to the user.
- Keylogger logs your keystrokes on your keyboard which is usually used to get a password. 
- Phishing: usually sent in emails, click on a link, and you're likely going to lose access of your computer.
