------Final Idea: Jeopardy Game-------

We will create a jeopardy game consisting of a score and a bunch of true or false questions. Certain true or false questions will be worth more points than others. There will be a button that causes the question to appear, which the user then answers - if the user is correct their score will be added, and if they are wrong it is subtracted.

How it meets requirements:
List - there is a list of variables which represent the questions.

There is a procedure to determine the score and if the question was answered correctly. It checks the value of the input, then goes through the procedure to see if it adds to the score or subtracts from it.

The algorithm includes sequencing because you go through if then statements to see if the answer is correct. There is selection as the score is only added to if a certain answer is inputted. In addition, there is iteration through the array of questions in order to display the questions.

The student developed procedure is called to upon pressing the submit answer button.

There is input as the user types in the answer that they believe to be true.

The output comes in the form of the score, as based on the user input this output will be produced.
