What can I do with Tech to improve mine or others education?

- I think that this is a pretty interesting question and to answer it, we need to dive deeper on what has already been done. Products such as Amazon, Google, and sites like GoFundMe all have a broad impact on the world, and they all have to do with Tech. In terms of education, personally, I believe sites like KhanAcademy really help out people who need extra help in their education, which their teacher cannot provide (or does not have the time to provide for each individual student). I can create different websites to help with education, like what we did in CSP the first two tris. A deployed website makes this accessible to everyone, and benefits a ton of people. In terms of my specific main contribution to the project, the sports quiz, it gained a lot of attention from the people who saw our website and many had a lot of fun playing it, while also gaining extensive knowledge about sports. Overall, I think that sites like KhanAcademy need to be more formally recognized due to the massive impact and change they have had on people, which I can also pull from a personal experience.

TPT Notes (5.1 - 5.6)
--------------------

[5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RXc68oLrmCTquHnKL4IQV9qIqkvJQb4L/view?usp=sharing)

- Different products can have different effects on the industry.
- Few examples
   - Multirotor, Quadcopter, 3D Printers
   - Internet can also have plenty of harmful impacts, as many people are heavily addicted to it. The Internet is used more than sleeping, according to the CB video. 
- Transactions Within Games
   - This can lead to many problems, like overspending, or kids spending money on their parents' credit cards, which can lead to financial problems. 


[5.2 Digital Divide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MXKE5eKrMnXbcsAblrk7Bp0HRPcLy6Ub/view?usp=sharing)
- The main problem with this is that many people are underprivileged and do not have access to any sort of technology, namely a computer of some sort. People are in rural areas and this is defined as the digital divide.
- In some places, the internet is used as protection, not as something that can be used by the normal civilian (govt stuff)

[5.3 Computing Bias](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b8-Ou9aGQezmaZRsTEWaY2JZIwdHIzxE/view?usp=sharing)
- There is a lot of bias within computing, mainly within explicit and implicit data. Explicit data would be a streaming site, (my own example being Amazon Prime), with your name and information, while implicit data could be what movies/shows you see. 

- Prime Video itself can also be biased, as it can redirect you to certain shows that you want to actually see, rather than boring movies, according to your recent searches. This can be something like Youtube Kids. 

[5.4 Crowdsourcing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kgvjhR_EMEe3h5A5aa1idbKRXEEzTj7N/view?usp=sharing)
- Crowdsourcing is basically using a large population to market a certain idea or product. These things could be used in collaboration with others as well, examples being spotify. GoFundMe is also an example of crowd sourcing as it is a way to get money by collaborating with others. 

[5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-ezX6JN6ACtUE4fXxvd2TnkaVcoFzD65/view?usp=sharing)
- In terms of legal and ethical concerns, there can be copyrights and protection of intellectual property. 
- To go deeper into copyrights (legal copyrighting):
   - Creative Commons
   - Open source 
   - Open Access

[5.6 Safe Computing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JIxOvsWfI9YyXgqx6PQwXC6Xsw5T-pPP/view?usp=sharing)

- Safe computing techniques would be understanding how to only distribute information that is not personal to you and is not needed by the program. This can be your social security number, which if given, can result in identity theft. 
- Things like Keyloggers, Phising, and Rogue Access Points can also be detrimental to the user.
- Keylogger logs your keystrokes on your keyboard which is usually used to get a password. 
- Phishing: usually sent in emails, click on a link, and you're likely going to lose access of your computer.

Github Actions TPT
-----------------
5.1:
Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
- Beneficial: Ability to access more resources, interact with new people, learn new information. 
- Harmful: Ability to get addicted, have more dopamine issues, bad people can show up on the internet (think dark web)

Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
- There are real dopamine issues that people have. This isn't just some conspiracy theory; many people are heavily addicted to computing, specifically video games. 

5.2:
How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
- Someone can empower themself in a digital world because they can get ranks or higher positions for being better in video games, while their real life crumbles before their eyes. 


How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
- Someone that is empowered can help someone that is not empowered by helping them get access to technological resources. Something in Del Norte would be giving a computer to someone else in order to help them submit their assignment. 


Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
- Yes. Red tape could be exhibited in the example of the school blocking various websites, specifically in Del Norte. Elsewhere, paper can be used for tests, rather than computers possibly because of a lack of technological access, contributing further to the digital divide. 

5.3:
Watch the video... [HP computers are racist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4DT3tQqgRM)
Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...
Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
How do you think this happened?
Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
Should it be corrected?
What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?

5.4: 
CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?


5.5:
When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.

5.6:
Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
