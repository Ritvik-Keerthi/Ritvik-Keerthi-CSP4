Capture the Moment

What can I do with Tech to improve mine or others education?

- I think that this is a pretty interesting question and to answer it, we need to dive deeper on what has already been done. Products such as Amazon, Google, and sites like GoFundMe all have a broad impact on the world, and they all have to do with Tech. In terms of education, personally, I believe sites like KhanAcademy really help out people who need extra help in their education, which their teacher cannot provide (or does not have the time to provide for each individual student). I can create different websites to help with education, like what we did in CSP the first two tris. A deployed website makes this accessible to everyone, and benefits a ton of people. In terms of my specific main contribution to the project, the sports quiz, it gained a lot of attention from the people who saw our website and many had a lot of fun playing it, while also gaining extensive knowledge about sports. Overall, I think that sites like KhanAcademy need to be more formally recognized due to the massive impact and change they have had on people, which I can also pull from a personal experience.
